Task 1: Dealing with hCaptcha while web scraping
# You can use Selenium for browser automation and handling captchas
from selenium import webdriver

# Initialize a headless browser
options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
options.add_argument('--headless')
driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)

# Visit the webpage
driver.get('https://example.com/page')  # Replace with the actual URL

# Continue with your scraping code
# ...

# Remember to close the browser when done
driver.quit()

TASK 2:Estimating income range from LinkedIn profiles
WITH CODES

# Note: This is a simplified example and should be taken as a rough estimate only.

def estimate_income(profile):
    # Define income ranges based on job titles and industries (you may need to customize this)
    income_ranges = {
        'Software Engineer': (70000, 120000),
        'Data Scientist': (80000, 130000),
        'Product Manager': (90000, 150000),
        'Marketing Manager': (75000, 120000),
        # Add more job titles and their corresponding income ranges
    }

    # Get job title and industry from the profile (you'll need to implement a function for this)
    job_title = get_job_title(profile)
    industry = get_industry(profile)

    # Use the job title and industry to estimate income
    if job_title in income_ranges and industry in income_ranges[job_title]:
        return income_ranges[job_title][industry]
    else:
        return None

def get_job_title(profile):
    # Implement a function to extract job title from the LinkedIn profile
    # This could involve web scraping, NLP, or using the LinkedIn API (if available)
    pass

def get_industry(profile):
    # Implement a function to extract industry information from the LinkedIn profile
    # Similar to job title, this might involve web scraping, NLP, or using the LinkedIn API
    pass

# Example usage
linkedin_profile = {
    'name': 'John Doe',
    'job_title': 'Software Engineer',
    'industry': 'Information Technology and Services'
}

estimated_income = estimate_income(linkedin_profile)

if estimated_income is not None:
    print(f"Estimated income range for {linkedin_profile['name']} is ${estimated_income[0]} - ${estimated_income[1]}")
else:
    print(f"Could not estimate income for {linkedin_profile['name']}")

TASK 3:- Finding LinkedIn company links
import requests

def get_linkedin_url(company_name):
    # Make a request to LinkedIn API
    response = requests.get(f'https://www.linkedin.com/voyager/api/search/blended?keywords={company_name}&origin=GLOBAL_SEARCH_HEADER')

    # Parse the JSON response
    data = response.json()
    
    # Extract the LinkedIn profile URL of the first company (you may need to adjust based on API response structure)
    linkedin_url = data['elements'][0]['hitInfo']['com.linkedin.voyager.search.SearchOrganizationHit']['publicIdentifier']

    return f'https://www.linkedin.com/company/{linkedin_url}'

# Example usage
company_name = 'Google'
linkedin_url = get_linkedin_url(company_name)
print(f'LinkedIn URL for {company_name}: {linkedin_url}')

TASK 4:-How to identify list of companies whose tech stack is built on Python. Give names of 5 companies if possible, by your suggested approach

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def find_python_companies():
    url = "https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=python&l="
    response = requests.get(url)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
        companies = []

        # Extract company names from the job listings
        for listing in soup.find_all(class_='jobsearch-SerpJobCard'):
            company = listing.find(class_='company')
            if company:
                companies.append(company.text.strip())

        return companies
    else:
        print(f"Error fetching data. Status code: {response.status_code}")
        return []

python_companies = find_python_companies()

# Print the first 5 companies (you can adjust the number)
print(python_companies[:5])


TASK 5:. Need to find an API, through which we can send linkedin messages to other linkedin users

Sending LinkedIn messages programmatically via an API is not supported by LinkedIn's public API as of my last knowledge update in September 2021. 
LinkedIn's API does not provide direct access to messaging features to prevent misuse and spam.
If you need to send messages on LinkedIn, you'll have to do it manually through the LinkedIn platform.
Be sure to follow LinkedIn's terms of service and policies regarding messaging and automation. Always respect privacy and avoid any activities that may violate user agreements.
